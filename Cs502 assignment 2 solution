Question No. 1: Time Complexity of Pseudo Code

Let's count how many times the print(z) command runs.

1. The Inner Loop (z-loop):
   · z starts at 8 and goes down by 2 each time: 8, 6, 4, 2.
   · That's 4 times.
2. The Middle Loop (y-loop):
   · y runs from 1 to 3.
   · That's 3 times.
3. The Outer Loop (x-loop):
   · x runs from 1 to n.
   · That's n times.

Total Calculation:
To get the total,we multiply the number of times each loop runs:
n (from x-loop) × 3 (from y-loop) × 4 (from z-loop) = 12n

Final Simple Answer:
The time complexity isO(n). This means the time it takes grows directly in proportion to n.

Question No. 2: Solving the Recurrence Relation for Heapify

We are given this formula:
T(n) = T(n/2) + c
(Where c is a small, constant amount of work.)

Let's solve it step-by-step:

1. Expand the formula:
   · T(n) = T(n/2) + c
   · What is T(n/2)? It's T(n/4) + c. So,
             T(n) = [T(n/4) + c] + c = T(n/4) + 2c
   · What is T(n/4)? It's T(n/8) + c. So,
             T(n) = [T(n/8) + c] + 2c = T(n/8) + 3c
2. See the pattern:
   · Every time we expand, we are cutting n in half and adding one more c.
   · The pattern is: T(n) = T(n / 2^k) + k × c
3. Find where it stops:
   · The process stops when the problem size becomes 1 (n / 2^k = 1).
   · This means 2^k = n, so k = log₂(n).
4. Final step:
   · Plug k = log₂(n) into the pattern:
             T(n) = T(1) + log₂(n) × c
   · T(1) is just a constant, so it's very small.

Final Simple Answer:
The time complexity isO(log n). This is very fast, like searching through a phone book by always cutting the search area in half.
